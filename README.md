# Projects I've Worked On:


## NAU Senior Capstone Project
**Under active development, final prototype due Week of 3/20**

In this project, I have taken the role of Team Lead for our team GreenAZ. The mission of the project is to develop a web visualization system with a MEAN stack application, and GIS mapping technologies. It will be deployed with Podman/Docker.

View the pre-development website here: https://ceias.nau.edu/capstone/projects/CS/2022/GreenAZ_F22/

When the project is complete, it will be accessible for the public to test here: https://ceias.nau.edu/circularize/
