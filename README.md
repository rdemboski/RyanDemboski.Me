# Projects I've Worked On:


## NAU Senior Capstone Project
**Under active development, final prototype due Week of 3/20**

In this project, I have taken the role of Team Lead for our team GreenAZ. The mission of the project is to develop a web visualization system with a MEAN stack application, and GIS mapping technologies. It will be deployed with Podman/Docker.

## Social Square - Event Organizing Platform

This was a project for NAU's Software Engineering course. I took it my Junior year.

It is an ASP.NET Core application that uses an MVC architecture. It also used Razor web pages for CSHTML functionality. I was with a group of 5 people, and I was team lead & the main backend developer. I also served as the quality assurance lead and I reviewed all pull-requests.

Check out the demo video below!

## Java Web Socket Server

This was a project I completed last semester for my Computer Networks class. I learned how to use Java Sockets to create a web server that can GET/POST HTTP requests. I used several console logs to show when a client connects, what the HTTP packets are

## Java GUI Application With Backend - Enroll Students Into College Classes

This was my final project for my Database Systems course at NAU. I took it during my Sophomore year. In this project I learned how to utilize Java to make a full stack GUI application. In this case I was using MySQL and phpMyAdmin as the database system.

Check out the demo video below!

## Data Structures & Algorithms

<img src="datastructs.jpeg" width="300" height="250" />

I took a Data Structures course my Sophomore year, and I'm currently taking Algorithms during my final semester. In these classes I've learned the basics of the most common data structures, and how to use them to solve complex algorithm puzzles with code. In these classes, we used Java and C for our solutions.

Also, we were taught about Big-O notation, Time and Space complexity, and Best/Worst case scenarios.

I'm very involved on LeetCode, Daily Algorithm Problem websites, and actively participate in mock interviews to continue to brush my skills on these essential topics.

Lastly, I helped tutor the Data Structures course at NAU for 3 years (CS-249).
