# Projects I've Worked On:


## NAU Senior Capstone Project
**Under active development, final prototype due Week of 3/20**

In this project, I have taken the role of Team Lead for our team GreenAZ. The mission of the project is to develop a web visualization system with a MEAN stack application, and GIS mapping technologies. It will be deployed with Podman/Docker.

## Java Web Socket Server

This was a project I completed last semester for my Computer Networks class. I learned how to use Java Sockets to create a web server that can GET/POST HTTP requests. I used several console logs to show when a client connects, what the HTTP packets are
